## 📝 Introduction

**Hollowveil** is a charming top-down adventure RPG where you play as Aren, a shipwreck survivor who washes up on a mysterious island. After regaining consciousness on an unfamiliar beach, Aren must explore the island, uncovering its secrets and the strange events that have twisted its once-peaceful forests.

Guided by a local herbalist named Lily and a reclusive former warrior named Garron, Aren learns about the rise of the Raccoon King—an enormous creature who was once a harmless forest dweller. Now empowered by a strange, magical calamari, the Raccoon King rules the forest with brute strength, supported by an army of raccoon and reptile minions.

## 🎮 Diversifiers

- **Boost**: The Calamari power-up increases the player's maximum health when consumed.
- **Inventory**: Aren can collect and manage various weapons and items through a comprehensive inventory system. Players can:
    - Cycle between weapons using **Q/E** keys.
    - Directly select items with number keys (**1-9**).
    - Toggle the inventory UI with the **I** key to display collected items in a grid format, with visual indicators for equipped weapons.
- **Boss Fight**: The King Racoon serves as the game's boss. It features increased health, stronger attacks, and a larger size compared to regular raccoons. Defeating the King Racoon triggers a victory dialogue sequence and transitions to the game's credits.
