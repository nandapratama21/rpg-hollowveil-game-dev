## 🎮 Diversifiers

- **Boost**: The Calamari power-up increases the player's maximum health when consumed.
- **Inventory**: Aren can collect and manage various weapons and items through a comprehensive inventory system. Players can:
    - Cycle between weapons using **Q/E** keys.
    - Directly select items with number keys (**1-9**).
    - Toggle the inventory UI with the **I** key to display collected items in a grid format, with visual indicators for equipped weapons.
- **Boss Fight**: The King Racoon serves as the game's boss. It features increased health, stronger attacks, and a larger size compared to regular raccoons. Defeating the King Racoon triggers a victory dialogue sequence and transitions to the game's credits.
